# SysAdmin-Tutorials

This is a project that I worked on throughout my Stystem Administration course at Grand Canyon University. It goes through the basics of standing up both a Windows Server and Windows Workstation VM, basic administration tasks, and general IT knowledge on the field. Do with this as you wish.
